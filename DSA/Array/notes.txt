Data Structures and Algorithms

Dsa :- Data Structure are different ways of organizing data on your Computer, that can be used effectively.
Algorithms :- Sets of instructions to perform a Task.
Types of DSA :- Primitive and Non-Primitive
    Primitive :- Integer, Float, Boolean, String
    Non-Primitive :- Linear and Non-Linear
        Linear :- List, Tuple, Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue
        Non-Linear :- Set, Dictionary, Tree, Graph
Types of Algorithms :- 
    Sorting :- To store data in ascending or descending order
    Searching :- To find the specific Value in data set
    Graph :- To work with data that can be represented as Graph
    Dynamic Programming :- To solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems
    Divide and Conquer :- To solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems, 
                          solving each sub-problems independently, and then combining the results
    Recursive :- To solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems
                 that are similar in nature


Big O Notation = Efficiency of Algorithms

Runtime Complexities :-

O(1)    Constant    A simple add number function
O(N)    Linear      Loop through numbers form 1 to n 
O(N²)   Quadric     Nested Loop
O(LogN) Logarithmic Find an element in sorted Array
O(2ⁿ)   Exponential Double recursion in Fibonacci
